# Running a snake-game in a Docker Container
This repository contains all the files required to a simple snake game in a docker container.

# Snake game overview
This is a snake game which can be accessed using a web browser. It's made up of a css, js, and an index.html file.

# Getting started:

# Creating folders
Before you get started with creating a container, create a master folder called snake-game or snake.
Create two folders in this master folder and name them css and js. Move the .css and .js files to their respective folders.

# Creating a source folder
Create a new folder and name it 'src' and copy the index.html and two folders into this newly created folder. 

# Creating a dockerfile

Move one directory up and download the Dockerfile at this location. At this point the master folder will have the src folder
and the dockerfile.

# Building an image

Make sure Docker service is up and running. Build an image based on the dockerfile present in the master folder.

Command: docker build -t snake-game . 
-- 
-t is used to name the image. Here the name is "snake-game".

# Starting a container

Start a container using an image that's recently created.

command: sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 --name snake snake-game
--
port 80 has been used on the host and also on the container for the app to run. 
Change the host port to any other port as per your requirement.

# Verifying results
Once the container is up and running, open a web browser and type in either container_ip/index.html or localhost/index.html 
and check the results. Click on the start button to start the snake game.

Note: The code files used in the repo were taken from an AWS twitch session about hosting a static website.
